# Changes from the Plum Tree app

If you are familiar with the original Plum Tree app, you might notice some differences in the Prune Tree app. This 
guide will cover the main differences between the two apps and what you should look out for. Feel free to skip to the 
next guide if you're new to the app.

## Tree Storage

Since the Prune Tree app is using a much simpler backend, your trees and their data, including all your Sims and images 
are now stored in your browser. This means that you can only access your trees from the browser you created them in.

Make sure to read the [browser storage guide](/guides/storage) to learn about the pitfalls and limitations of browser
storage, as accidentally clearing your browser data could result in losing your trees.

## Tree Sharing

Since the trees are stored in your browser, you can no longer share trees with other users. The main way to share your 
Sims family legacy with others is currently to take a screenshot of your tree and share it with others. 

There are however [plans](https://github.com/TrueKuehli/PruneTree/issues/8) to add a way to export your tree as a file that you can share with others, as well as 
adding an easier way to download your tree as an image. Keep an eye on the changelog on the [version page](/version) 
for updates on this feature!
