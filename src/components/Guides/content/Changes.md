# Changes from the Plum Tree app

If you are familiar with the original Plum Tree app, you might notice some differences in the Prune Tree app. This 
guide will cover the main differences between the two apps and what you should look out for. Feel free to skip to the 
next guide if you're new to the app.

## Tree Storage

Since the Prune Tree app is using a much simpler backend, your trees and their data, including all your Sims and images 
are now stored in your browser. This means that you can only access your trees from the browser you created them in.

Make sure to read the [browser storage guide](/guides/storage) to learn about the pitfalls and limitations of browser
storage, as accidentally clearing your browser data could result in losing your trees.

## Tree Sharing

Since the trees are stored in your browser, you can no longer share trees with other users using a simple link. The 
main way to share your Sims family legacy with others is to take a screenshot of your tree. 

Another option is to use the [backup feature](/guides/download-and-backup) to export a tree as a single zip file. You can send this file to others,
and they can import it into their own browser. This will create a copy of the tree in their browser, including every
Sim the tree contains and all the images. The copy will be completely separate from your own tree, so any changes
they make will not affect your tree.

Other ways to export your tree are [planned](https://github.com/TrueKuehli/PruneTree/issues/8) as well to allow for easier sharing and saving of your trees. 
Keep an eye on the changelog on the [version page](/version) for updates on this and other features!
