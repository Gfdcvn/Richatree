# Tree Downloads and Backups

To ensure that you don't lose your trees, you should make frequent backups. This guide will show you how to download 
your trees and how to import them again. Keep in mind that the backups themselves are not viewable outside the app,
and need to be imported again to be viewed.

Other ways to export your tree in a viewable format are [planned](https://github.com/TrueKuehli/PruneTree/issues/8), which will also help with sharing your trees.
Keep an eye on the changelog on the [version page](/version) for updates on this and other features!

## Downloading a tree

To download a tree, open the tree menu and click the "Download" button. This will navigate you to the download page,
where you can click the "Download" button again to download the tree. This will download a zip file containing all
the data of the tree, including all Sims and images. The file will be named after the tree, but you can rename the file 
to whatever you want. Just make sure to keep the `.zip` extension if your OS displays it.

## Importing a tree

To import a tree, first go to the Create Tree page. Then, click the "Import" button. This will open a file picker, where
you can select the zip file you want to import. After selecting the file, the tree will be imported and you will be
redirected to the tree page.
