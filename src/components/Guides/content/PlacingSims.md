# Placing Sims in Your Tree

Sims and tree structures are two separate things in The Prune Tree so once you've added some Sims you'll want to master 
how place them to form a tree.

Remember you'll have to have already created your Sims before you can place them in a tree

## Add Your Sim

To set the Sim for a node click the **Wrench Icon** on a node.

Click **Set This Nodes Person** and select one of you Sims from the dropdown.

## Add Your Sim's Partners

To set a Sim's partners in a node click the **Wrench Icon** on a node.

Click **Set This Node's Partners**.

Add partner rows using the **Add Partner** button. These will be displayed above each other to the right of the Node 
person.

You can add multiple Sims into each partner row you add. These will display to the right of each previous partner in 
that row.

It's up to you how you organise a node partners. Some people use multiple partners in a row to show a partner's other 
partners. Others use it when a lots of partners would otherwise take up too much space when placed above each other.

When you're done, click **Save**.

## Adding Children

To add children to a tree click the **Plus Icon** below a node.

On the new node click the **Wrench Icon** and set the Node person as described above.

When you're in the Node edit main screen go down and click **Set This Nodes Parent Details**.

When you set the nodes parents this information will be in that Sims info panel. This is useful if a parent Node has 
many partners, the child was adopted or something else that isn't made apparent by the tree itself.

Scroll down to the bottom of the edit node page and click **Delete This Node** and confirm you want to delete it.
