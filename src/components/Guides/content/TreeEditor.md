# The Tree Editor

Once you've created your tree before you dive in make sure you're familiar with the tree editor. Get to know it, take 
it out for dinner, live a long and happy life together or something along those lines.

## The Tree Editor Toolbar

The tree editor toolbar lets you get to many areas when it comes to editing your tree.

### Actions - Save Tree

Under **Actions** you can save your tree. The prune tree auto saves as you modify your tree but this lets you be 
certain everything is saved. A success message will appear to confirm the save.

### Actions - Delete Tree

If you no longer want a tree you can delete it. You'll be asked to confirm if you want to delete a tree in case you 
click this option accidentally.

### Edit - Tree Details

Under **Edit** you can update the tree details you entered when you first created your tree.

These are things such as the trees title, description or cover image which are all shown in the tree info pane and 
gallery if the tree is published there.

### Edit - People in Tree

Before you start creating your trees links between sims, their children, parents and partners you'll need to have some 
Sims at hand.

Going to **Edit** and selecting **People in Tree** takes you to the people manager where you 
can add, edit or delete people you will be placing in yur tree.

The guide **Adding/Editing Sims** goes into more details on what you can do there and how.

## The Tree Structure

The Prune Tree separates the Sims and the structure of your trees into two separate concepts. You'll create some Sims 
and you'll also create a structure that shows the links between parents and children.

Then you'll place the Sims you created into the structure you created to form a family tree.

When you first create a tree below the toolbar you'll see a single empty **Node**.

Think of a **Node** as a point in a tree where you'll add a Sim and their partners.

**Nodes** below this one signify the children of the Sim and their partner(s) above.

Each **Nodes** has two buttons. The one to the left showing the wrench lets you add details to the **Node** such as the 
Sim, their partners, and details about how the sim of the **Node** was conceived by their parents (i.e. were they 
adopted, cloned, or the result of an alien abduction ðŸ‘½).

The button below allows you to add child **Nodes**, each of which you can set up in the same way as the initial 
**Node** by clicking the wrench for that child.

You can keep adding as many child **Nodes** to any depth as you need. Just remember you'll need to create the Sims you 
want to put in a **Node** beforehand.
