# Link Multiple Trees Together

Some Sims like to get around and can find themselves in more than one tree. This guide will take you through
linking up those trees. Since there is currently no way to share trees directly with other users, links can only
connect your own trees.

## Preparations

Before you link two trees you'll have to gather the tree ID and person ID you want to link to. 
If you want to link back from the tree your linking to you'll have to get these details from both trees.

To get the tree ID and person ID go to the tree you want to link to:

Find the person you want to link to in that tree and click their avatar to open the persons details panel.

At the very bottom is a small link titled **Show Link Details**. Click it to reveal the tree ID
and person ID and make a note of each.

## Linking Sims

In the tree you want to link from - in the editor toolbar under **Edit** click **People in Tree**.

Find the Sim you want to link from in the list of Sims and click the **Link** button in that row.

Enter a title for your link.

Enter the tree ID and person ID you noted earlier from the tree and person to want to link to.

Click the **Link Person** button to create the link.

You can link out to as many trees as you want.

Remember you may want to link back from the tree your linking to. Just repeat the steps above just the other way around.

Now anytime your linked person is placed in your tree they will have an icon next to their avatar that reveals a list 
of the links you created.

## Removing Links

In the tree you want to remove a link from - in the editor toolbar under **Edit** click **People in Tree**.

Find the Sim you want to remove a link from in the list of Sims and click the **Link** button in that row.

Find the link you want to remove in the list and click **Delete**.
