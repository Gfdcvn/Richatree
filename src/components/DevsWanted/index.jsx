      <p>Interested in helping build The Plum Tree?</p>
      <p>The Plum Tree is built by just me, a single developer and not an entire team as many seem to believe. However I'm looking into changing that.</p>
      <p>The Plum Tree makes no money (it loses quite a bit instead each month to server costs) so I can't pay anyone.</p>
      <p>I'm also only looking for people who already have at least some skills in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>REST APIs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I don't have the available time to teach all of this to someone new but if you already know some of the above I am willing to work and help you up-skill where needed.</p>
      <p>If you are interested feel free to drop me an email info@theplumtreeapp.com and I'll get back to you.</p>
