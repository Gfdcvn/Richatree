## FAQ

How can I share the trees I create with the Prune Tree app?
:   Currently, the best way to share trees is to take a screenshot of them. There are features planned to make this
    much easier, so have a lookout on the [Version page](/version) for updates. If you want to add to the discussion on
    that feature, you can also leave a comment on this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/TrueKuehli/PruneTree/issues/8).


Can I import trees from the Plum tree app?
:   No, there currently is no way to import trees from the Plum tree app. However, there are currently plans to add an
    import feature for trees downloaded from the Plum tree app while it was still available. If you want to add to the
    discussion, feel free to leave a comment on this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/TrueKuehli/PruneTree/issues/8).
    If you have downloaded trees from the Plum tree app before, you can also provide them there to help with testing
    the feature.

I made some trees with the Prune Tree app, but they're suddenly gone!
:   The Prune Tree app currently stores all trees locally on your device. Some things to check are if you switched to
    another device or browser to access the app. If you still have access to that device or browser, you can export the
    trees from there and import them on your current device or browser. If you don't have access to that device or
    browser anymore, and have not made any backups, there is no way to recover the trees.

I want to look at the source code or use it for my own project!
:   The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/TrueKuehli/PruneTree). It is licensed under the ISC
    license, so you can use it for your own projects as long as you include the license file found in the root of the
    repository.

I want to host my own version of the Prune Tree app!
:   You can self-host the app using the files provided on [GitHub](https://github.com/TrueKuehli/PruneTree/releases).
    Each time the app is updated, a new release is published there, which you can download and host yourself. Since the
    app is a static website, you can host it on any web server and don't have to set up any backend code.

I want to help with the development of the Prune Tree app!
:   That's great! Any pull requests improving the app are highly appreciated! If you want to add a new feature, it's
    best to first open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/TrueKuehli/PruneTree/issues/new) or check if there is
    already an issue for it. This way, we can discuss the feature and make sure it fits the app. If you want to fix a
    bug, you can also open an issue or directly create a pull request. If you want to help with the development of the
    app, but don't know where to start, you can also check out the 
    [GitHub issues](https://github.com/TrueKuehli/PruneTree/issues) page for issues marked with the `help wanted` label.
